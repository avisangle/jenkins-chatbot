# Jenkins Chatbot with AI Agent Implementation Plan

## Architecture Overview
```
User Input → Jenkins Plugin UI → Chat Service → AI Agent → MCP Client → MCP Server → Jenkins API
           ↓                    ↓              ↓             ↓
    User Token → User Credentials → User Context → MCP Protocol → Delegated API Calls
```

### Delegated Authorization Flow
```
1. User authenticates with Jenkins
2. Jenkins Plugin generates short-lived user token
3. Plugin passes user token + permissions to AI Agent
4. AI Agent uses MCP client to call MCP server tools with user context
5. MCP Server makes Jenkins API calls with delegated user permissions
6. Jenkins validates user permissions for each API operation
```

## Phase 1: AI Agent Selection & Setup (Week 1)

### Google Gemini API Integration (Selected)
- **Set up Google Gemini API access** (Google AI Studio account, API keys)
- **Create AI Agent service** (Python microservice with FastAPI)
- **Implement conversation management** with context tracking
- **Add MCP server integration** as tool calling mechanism

### AI Agent Components
- **Conversation Manager**: Maintains chat history and context

## Enhanced Redis State Management

### Redis Schema Design

#### Session Management
```redis
# User session with unique key
session:{user_id}:{session_uuid} = {
  "user_id": "jenkins_user_123",
  "permissions": ["Job.BUILD", "Job.READ", "Item.CREATE"],
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2024-01-01T12:15:00Z",
  "jenkins_token": "encrypted_token_here",
  "last_activity": "2024-01-01T12:05:00Z"
}
TTL: 900 seconds (15 minutes)
```

#### Conversation Context
```redis
# Conversation history and context
conversation:{session_id} = {
  "messages": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
      "role": "user",
      "content": "trigger frontend build",
      "user_id": "jenkins_user_123"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:01Z",
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I'll trigger the frontend-build job...",
      "actions_taken": ["build_triggered"]
    }
  ],
  "context": {
    "current_jobs": ["frontend-build", "backend-api"],
    "last_build_status": {"frontend-build": "SUCCESS"},
    "workspace_info": "/var/jenkins_home/workspace",
    "pending_actions": []
  }
}
TTL: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
```

#### State Tracking
```redis
# Pending actions and job states
pending_actions:{session_id} = {
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_id": "uuid",
      "type": "jenkins_build",
      "job_name": "frontend-build",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
      "user_id": "jenkins_user_123"
    }
  ]
}
TTL: 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
```

#### Permission Cache
```redis
# Cache user permissions to reduce Jenkins API calls
permissions:{user_id} = {
  "permissions": ["Job.BUILD", "Job.READ", "Item.CREATE"],
  "jobs_accessible": ["frontend-build", "backend-api"],
  "cached_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
TTL: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
```

### State Management Operations

#### Session Lifecycle
1. **Session Creation**: Generate UUID, store user context, set TTL
2. **Activity Tracking**: Update last_activity on each interaction
3. **Token Refresh**: Renew Jenkins tokens before expiry
4. **Session Cleanup**: Automatic expiry and manual logout cleanup

#### Data Retention Policies
- **Active Sessions**: 15-minute TTL with activity renewal
- **Conversation History**: 1-hour TTL for context continuity
- **Permission Cache**: 5-minute TTL for security freshness
- **Pending Actions**: 30-minute TTL for action completion tracking

## User Access Control Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Chat box appears only when user logs into Jenkins**
- **User access limited by Jenkins granted privileges**
- **Cannot trigger jobs without proper Jenkins permissions**
- **AI commands filtered based on user's Jenkins ACL**

### Permission Integration
```java
// Example permission check in Jenkins plugin
if (!user.hasPermission(Job.BUILD, job)) {
    // Filter out build-related AI suggestions
    // Return permission denied message
}
```

### AI Agent Capabilities
1. **Natural Language Understanding**: "Build the frontend and deploy to staging"
2. **Permission Awareness**: "I see you don't have deployment permissions, but I can trigger the build for you"
3. **Context Retention**: "The build you asked about earlier has completed successfully"
4. **Proactive Suggestions**: "Your build failed - common fixes include checking environment variables"

## Security Considerations

### Delegated Authorization Model
- **No Elevated AI Agent Privileges**: AI Agent never uses admin credentials
- **User Token Delegation**: Jenkins Plugin generates short-lived tokens (15-minute expiry)
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Every API call restricted by user's specific permissions
- **Token Validation**: All tokens validated against Jenkins user session

### Core Security Measures
- **API Key Management**: Secure storage of Google Gemini API keys
- **User Privacy**: No sensitive data sent to external AI services
- **Command Validation**: All AI-generated commands validated against user permissions
- **Delegated API Calls**: AI Agent makes Jenkins API calls with user credentials only

### Enhanced Audit Trail

#### Audit Trail Integration Points

**1. AI Agent Request Processing**
```python
# Log every incoming request
async def process_chat_request(request: ChatRequest):
    interaction_id = await audit_logger.log_ai_interaction(
        session_id=request.session_id,
        user_id=request.user_id,
        query=request.message,
        permissions=request.permissions
    )
    
    # Process request...
    
    # Log response and planned actions
    await audit_logger.update_ai_interaction(
        interaction_id=interaction_id,
        response=ai_response,
        actions_planned=planned_jenkins_calls,
        success=True
    )
```

**2. Jenkins API Call Tracking**
```python
# Wrap all Jenkins API calls with audit logging
async def make_jenkins_api_call(endpoint, method, user_context, request_body=None):
    start_time = time.time()
    
    call_log_id = await audit_logger.log_jenkins_api_call(
        session_id=user_context.session_id,
        user_id=user_context.user_id,
        endpoint=endpoint,
        method=method,
        permission_required=get_required_permission(endpoint),
        request_body=request_body
    )
    
    try:
        response = await jenkins_client.call(endpoint, method, user_context.token, request_body)
        
        await audit_logger.update_jenkins_api_call(
            call_log_id=call_log_id,
            status_code=response.status_code,
            response_body=response.json(),
            execution_time_ms=int((time.time() - start_time) * 1000),
            permission_granted=True
        )
        
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        await audit_logger.log_security_event(
            event_type="api_call_failed",
            user_id=user_context.user_id,
            details={"endpoint": endpoint, "error": str(e)}
        )
        raise
```

**3. Permission Validation Tracking**
```python
# Log all permission checks
async def validate_user_permission(user_context, required_permission, resource):
    has_permission = await jenkins_auth.check_permission(
        user_context.token, required_permission, resource
    )
    
    if not has_permission:
        await audit_logger.log_security_event(
            event_type="permission_denied",
            user_id=user_context.user_id,
            session_id=user_context.session_id,
            details={
                "required_permission": required_permission,
                "resource": resource,
                "user_permissions": user_context.permissions
            },
            severity="medium"
        )
    
    return has_permission
```

#### Audit Query Examples

**Security Monitoring Queries**
```sql
-- Failed permission attempts by user
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as failed_attempts, 
       array_agg(DISTINCT details->>'required_permission') as attempted_permissions
FROM security_events 
WHERE event_type = 'permission_denied' 
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

-- AI interactions leading to security events
SELECT ai.user_id, ai.user_query, se.event_type, se.details
FROM ai_interactions ai
JOIN security_events se ON ai.session_id = se.session_id
WHERE se.timestamp BETWEEN ai.timestamp AND ai.timestamp + INTERVAL '5 minutes';
```

**Performance Monitoring**
```sql
-- Slow Jenkins API calls
SELECT endpoint, AVG(execution_time_ms) as avg_time, COUNT(*) as call_count
FROM jenkins_api_calls
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY endpoint
HAVING AVG(execution_time_ms) > 1000
ORDER BY avg_time DESC;
```

**User Activity Analysis**
```sql
-- Most active users and their permissions usage
SELECT ai.user_id, COUNT(*) as interactions,
       array_agg(DISTINCT unnest(ai.permissions_used)) as permissions_used,
       COUNT(DISTINCT jac.id) as api_calls_made
FROM ai_interactions ai
LEFT JOIN jenkins_api_calls jac ON ai.id = jac.ai_interaction_id
WHERE ai.timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY ai.user_id
ORDER BY interactions DESC;
```

- **Development**: 4-6 weeks of development time

### Cost Optimization
- Implement conversation caching to reduce API calls
- Use shorter models for simple responses
- Set usage limits per user/session

## Robust Error Handling and User Feedback Strategy

### Error Classification and Response Strategy

#### 1. AI Comprehension Failures
**Scenario**: AI cannot understand user intent or request is ambiguous

**Response Strategy**:
```python
# Example AI responses for comprehension failures
COMPREHENSION_FAILURE_RESPONSES = {
    "unclear_intent": "I'm sorry, I don't understand that request. Could you please rephrase it?",
    "ambiguous_command": "I'm having trouble understanding what you mean by '{user_input}'. Could you be more specific?",
    "multiple_interpretations": "I see a few ways to interpret your request. Did you mean:\n• {option_1}\n• {option_2}\n• {option_3}",
    "missing_context": "I need more information to help you. Could you specify which job/build you're referring to?",
    "unsupported_operation": "I don't currently support that operation, but you can do it through the Jenkins UI at {jenkins_url}"
}
```

**Implementation**:
- Confidence scoring for AI responses (threshold: 0.7)
- Context-aware clarification prompts
- Suggest alternative phrasings or commands
- Provide links to relevant Jenkins UI sections

#### 2. Jenkins Operation Failures
**Scenario**: Jenkins API calls fail or operations encounter errors

**Response Strategy**:
```python
# Structured error responses for Jenkins operations
class JenkinsOperationError:
    def format_user_response(self, error_type: str, details: dict) -> str:
        responses = {
            "permission_denied": f"I don't have permission to {details['action']} for '{details['resource']}'. You need {details['required_permission']} permission.",
            "job_not_found": f"I couldn't find a job named '{details['job_name']}'. Here are similar jobs you can access: {details['suggestions']}",
            "build_failed": f"The build for '{details['job_name']}' failed. The error was: {details['error_summary']}. Common fixes include: {details['suggestions']}",
            "missing_parameters": f"The job '{details['job_name']}' requires these parameters: {details['required_params']}. Please provide values for them.",
            "queue_full": f"The build queue is currently full. Your job '{details['job_name']}' will start when capacity is available.",
            "node_offline": f"The build cannot start because the required node '{details['node_name']}' is offline. Contact your Jenkins administrator.",
        }
        return responses.get(error_type, f"An error occurred: {details.get('message', 'Unknown error')}")
```

**Error Context Enhancement**:
- Include specific error codes and messages
- Suggest actionable next steps
- Provide relevant documentation links
- Offer alternative approaches when possible

#### 3. System/Service Failures
**Scenario**: AI Agent, MCP server, or other system components are unavailable

**Fallback Hierarchy**:
```
1. AI Service Unavailable → Simple Command Matching
2. MCP Server Down → Direct Jenkins API with limited features
3. Jenkins API Issues → Queue requests with retry mechanism
4. Database Issues → In-memory session fallback
5. Complete System Failure → Clear user notification with alternatives
```

**User Communication Strategy**:
```python
SYSTEM_FAILURE_MESSAGES = {
    "ai_service_down": "The AI Chatbot is currently unavailable. Please try again later or use the standard Jenkins UI.",
    "mcp_server_down": "Some advanced features are temporarily unavailable. Basic commands still work.",
    "jenkins_api_slow": "Jenkins is responding slowly. Your request may take longer than usual.",
    "database_issues": "Your conversation history may not be saved during this session.",
    "maintenance_mode": "The chatbot is undergoing maintenance. Expected to be back online at {estimated_time}."
}
```

### Error Handling Implementation

#### AI Agent Error Middleware
```python
@app.middleware("http")
async def error_handling_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    try:
        response = await call_next(request)
        return response
    except AIComprehensionError as e:
        return create_user_friendly_response(
            error_type="comprehension_failure",
            user_message=e.user_input,
            suggestions=e.suggestions
        )
    except JenkinsAPIError as e:
        return create_user_friendly_response(
            error_type="jenkins_operation_failure",
            details=e.details,
            recovery_actions=e.recovery_actions
        )
    except SystemServiceError as e:
        return create_degraded_service_response(
            service=e.service_name,
            fallback_options=e.fallback_options
        )
```

#### Jenkins Plugin Error Handling
```java
// Jenkins Plugin error handling
public class ChatErrorHandler {
    public ChatResponse handleAIServiceError(Exception error) {
        if (error instanceof ServiceUnavailableException) {
            return ChatResponse.builder()
                .message("The AI assistant is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.")
                .fallbackOptions(Arrays.asList("Use Jenkins UI", "Check system status"))
                .showFallbackUI(true)
                .build();
        }
        // Handle other error types...
    }
}
```

### User Experience Enhancement

#### Progressive Error Recovery
1. **Immediate Response**: Always provide an immediate acknowledgment
2. **Error Classification**: Categorize error and provide appropriate response
3. **Recovery Options**: Offer specific next steps or alternatives
4. **Learning Integration**: Learn from errors to improve future responses

#### Context-Aware Error Messages
```python
def generate_contextual_error_message(user_context: UserContext, error: Exception) -> str:
    base_message = get_base_error_message(error)
    
    # Add user-specific context
    if user_context.recent_jobs:
        base_message += f"\n\nBased on your recent activity with {user_context.recent_jobs}, "
        base_message += "you might be looking for one of these options:"
    
    # Add permission-aware suggestions
    if hasattr(error, 'required_permission'):
        accessible_alternatives = find_accessible_alternatives(
            user_context.permissions, 
            error.attempted_action
        )
        if accessible_alternatives:
            base_message += f"\n\nAlternatively, you can: {accessible_alternatives}"
    
    return base_message
```

    async def check_service_health(self) -> ServiceHealth:
        health = ServiceHealth()
        
        # AI Service health
        health.ai_service = await self.check_ai_service_health()
        
        # MCP Server health
        health.mcp_server = await self.check_mcp_server_health()
        
        # Jenkins API health
        health.jenkins_api = await self.check_jenkins_api_health()
        
        # Database health
        health.database = await self.check_database_health()
        
        return health
    
    async def determine_degradation_level(self, health: ServiceHealth) -> int:
        if health.all_services_healthy():
            return 1  # Full capabilities
        elif health.ai_service.healthy and health.jenkins_api.healthy:
            return 2  # Basic AI
        elif health.jenkins_api.healthy:
            return 3  # Command-only
        else:
            return 4  # Notification-only
```
